# ❤️ Heart Rate Prediction Model

## 🚀 Overview

This project implements a machine learning model to predict **heart rate** based on various physiological and environmental features. It helps monitor heart health and detect anomalies early — great for healthcare insights! 🩺📊

## ✨ Features

* 🧹 Data preprocessing and cleaning
* 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* 🛠️ Feature engineering
* 🤖 Model training (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest)
* 🔄 Cross-validation and performance evaluation
* 📈 Visualization of predictions vs actual heart rate

## 📂 Dataset

* Includes features like age, activity level, blood pressure, and more
* Data source: *\[Add your dataset source]*

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-rate-prediction.git
   cd heart-rate-prediction
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## ▶️ Usage

1. Prepare your data as described above
2. Train the model:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. Predict on new data:

   ```bash
   python predict.py --input data/new_patient.csv
   ```

## 📊 Model Evaluation

* Metrics like Accuracy, RMSE, etc.
* Cross-validation results included

## 📝 Example

```python
from model import HeartRatePredictor

model = HeartRatePredictor()
model.train(X_train, y_train)

predictions = model.predict(X_test)
print(predictions)
```
